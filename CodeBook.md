# DATA DICTIONARY â€“ SAMSUNG FITNESS WEARABLE DATA

### Procedure
The script run_analysis.R reads in the original data files (subject list, activity list and data for both test and training sessions) if the UCI HAR Dataset folder is in your working directory.  
  
**Steps**
- Test and training files are read.
- Column names for both training and test data are read from features.txt
- Only those columns are kept that contain means or standard deviations (case insensitive).
- Subject and activity identifiers are merged onto test and training sets.
- Now that common identifiers exist, both test and training sets are merged together.
- The resulting dataset now contains all measurements relating to means and standard deviations across all subjects, activities, and for both test and training sessions.
- The script iterates through each subject and each activity. For each combination of subject and activity (there are 30 * 6 = 180), a temporary subset of rows matching the combination is created. Within this set, the mean (i.e. average) of each column is calculated. All resulting values are put in a new data frame.
- By the end of these loops, a new data frame exists that contains one row per subject/activity combination, and the respective averages for each of the variables associated with that combination.
- Column names for the new data frame are taken from the original merged data frame.
- Activity levels are transformed into factors and renamed (from numbers to "Walking", etc).
- The final data frame is written into tidy\_data_set.txt in the working directory.
  
  
### Variables
**subject**  
Unique subject id from 1-30  
  
**activity**  
1 - Walking  
2 - Walking upstairs  
3 - Walking downstairs  
4 - Sitting  
5 - Standing  
6 - Lying  
  
**measurements**
Averages of the following variables from the original datasets were taken (variable names are the same in original and converted datasets). These are time and frequency domain variables; where suffixed with X, Y or Z, they are triaxial acceleration and velocity variables taken from an accelerometer and gyroscope, respectively.
